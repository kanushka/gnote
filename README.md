gnote is currently in development. It is a simple **note** application build as a **progressive web application**. So I encourage you to use it and give me your feedback.

### What is a Progressive Web App ?

> A Progressive Web App uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive, top-level apps, leveraging the web's low friction.

Because of that, this APP no need to install. just use URL https://kanushka.com/gnote/ from you mobile device.
The browser will automatically suggest  **add to Home Screen**.
So, you can just run in your device as a Native App. 

Now you can download this App to your laptop using chrome browser.
